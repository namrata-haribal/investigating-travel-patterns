# Investigating Travel Behavior

My classmates and I travel to a new city every semester as part of our undergraduate degree. We aspire to immerse and gain a deep understanding of the cities that host us, and so something we've wondered is how well we meet our city immersion goals. In an attempt to find an answer,  I investigated the travel patterns of some of my classsmates to ask questions about how well we were immersing in London - one of the cities in Minerva's global rotation program. I've uploaded my final paper as well as the code I wrote for my analysis.
